# tweet-clustering

## Purpose
This is an unsupervised learning project from my Machine Learning course. I use K-means to group related tweets together based on their string context. The comparison is done using the Jaccard Distance between strings.

## Background
### Jaccard Distance
The Jaccard index, also known as the Jaccard similarity coefficient, is a statistic used for gauging the similarity and diversity of sample sets.

## Data Source
Data comes from a personal repository of tweets taken from the internet. It is hosted on my personal google drive.
